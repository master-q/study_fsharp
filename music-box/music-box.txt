[Music box CUI]

Write an F# 2.0 code that implements a pseudo command-line music-box.
Using external libraries except fslex, fsyacc and FParsec is not allowed.

For the music-box, albums are stored in a text file in a serialized form such as json, xml or s-expression.

The following should be used as the type for storing a Song:

type Album = { Name: string; Year: int }
type Song = { Artist: string; Song: string; TimeInSec: int; Album: Album }

Also a play list that defines how songs in the album file are picked/played is stored in a text file.

The content of the play list should be:

- A series of select statements in a text file, and a select statement should allow you to:

  - extract songs with attributes of Song/Album types. 
    "<", ">" and "=" operators should be supported at minimum.

  - order/shuffle songs by attributes of Song/Album types

  - select top X from the selection result

An example of select statement is:   

select by Name = "Kirinji", Year > 2010 order Album, TimeInSec top 5

The music-box should support the following commands:

--init [file] ... initializes the music-box w/ the albums contained in the file
--load [file] ... loads and evaluates a play list defined in the file
--play        ... prints out the songs in the order they are played

Example execution:

$ music-box --init albums
$ music-box --load my-favorite-aor
$ music-box --play
